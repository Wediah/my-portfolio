        Hello, I'm Emmanuel Wediah, a final year student at <a href='https://atu.edu.gh/'>Accra Technical Universtity</a> studing Computer Science. Currently, my main focus is frontend web development as well as backend development with Laravel and PHP.
        <br/> I'm also a member of the <a href='https://gdsc.community.dev/accra-technical-university/'>Google Developers Student Club (GDSC)</a> at my school, where I help organize events and workshops for students to learn about Google technologies.
         <br/> I hope to learn more about artificial intelligence and machine learning in the future. Aside from programming, I enjoy photography and editing postcasts.
